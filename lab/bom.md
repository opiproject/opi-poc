another table probably needed:
- rack space for each device
- power used by each device
- power to heat to HVAC math

## Selection criteria

- features
- waranty
- support
- end of life date
- api availability
- integration with lab management tools
- availability
- price


## Server details

- cost to host each _PU 
- many in a server or each in a unique server
- mandatory features to test interaction with the host


### DPU HOST - RAX XS4-11S3-10G
	
- 1U
- Intel C621A Chipset - 4x NVMe/SATA - 1x M.2 - Dual Intel 10-Gigabit Ethernet (RJ45) - 600W Power Supply
